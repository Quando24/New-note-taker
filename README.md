# 🏁 New-note-taker 🏁
  # Description ✏️
  ### This homework assignment required me to create a Note taker while using Express.js, a Node.js server framework. My motivation stemmed from my desire to improve my familiarity with the terminal further while using express.js in coalition with Heroku. I built this assignment to learn how to develop applications using express.js that could be deployed onto Heroku; although difficult, it is possible. The problem served concerns how files and folders are set up in VS Code. If the two items are set up incorrectly, then the terminal will have major issues in trying to locate where things are on your computer.

  # Installation 📖
  I have to place my work onto Github. First you have to create a new repository and give it a name. Be sure to make this new repository public and add a readme. Once that is done, there will be a green button, and once clicked, clone will be at the top with three options underneath. Click the ssh option. And then copy the link. Then go to the terminal. open the directory (type in ls) and then change into the specific directory (type in cd and the name of the directory) that you would like to place this project. Then you have to run a git add . command, followed by, a git commit -m "enter description of changes made" command. Then lastly run a git push command to publish the project onto Github. Since we had to deploy this assignment to Heroku as well, After the work is done on Github, move on to Heroku. Then create a new app and give it a name. Then you have to link your completed Github work, to the created application on Heroku; this is done by clicking on the "deploy" section of your app, scrolling down to Deployment method, and then connecting your Github repository by name. Then be sure to enable "automatic deploys from main", so that all updates made on Github will be pushed to Heroku simultaneously.
